A virtual keyboard for wordle clone using Tkinter

Wordle keyboard by Steve Shambles, April 2023.

Requirements None.

I wrote this for a Wordle clone I'm going to write soon.
The '*' button is for delete and '=' for enter.

If you do not like the colours , font sizes etc they are all easy to tweak, see code comments.
